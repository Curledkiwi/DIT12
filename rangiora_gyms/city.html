        This is a fantastic gym, but it’s becoming an internet cafe. People sit on machines whilst scrolling on their
        phones, preventing others from using them. Staff: please put in a rule that if someone wishes to use their
        device, they should stand away from the machines as it’s almost impossible for people that go to the gym to work
        out to access any equipment. Also, don’t provide free WiFi. It’s a gym!!

        CityFitness Rangiora could be a fantastic gym with its excellent facilities and well-maintained equipment.
        However, the ownership and staff seem incredibly slack when it comes to maintaining order and ensuring the gym
        remains a safe environment. There are often groups of teens running around and treating the gym like a
        playground. Just yesterday, I saw several doing cartwheels and backflips in the middle of the gym, and the staff
        did nothing about it. On top of that, the teens frequently hog equipment and stay in one spot for extended
        periods, preventing others from using it. This isn’t an isolated incident — I’ve heard several complaints about
        this type of behavior, yet nothing ever seems to get done. It feels like they only care about collecting
        membership fees rather than providing a safe and respectful atmosphere. I hope management takes this feedback
        seriously and addresses the lack of supervision. The gym has so much potential, but it needs staff who are
        willing to enforce the rules.

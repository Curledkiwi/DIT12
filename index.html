    <h2>What is the Waimakariri</h2>
    <div style="border: 1px #d1c021 solid;padding: 5px;">
        Waimakariri is a district in the Canterbury region of New Zealandâ€™s South Island. It lies north of Christchurch
        and stretches from the coast to the foothills of the Southern Alps. The district includes towns like Rangiora,
        Kaiapoi, and Woodend, which are growing communities with a mix of rural and suburban living.
        Waimakariri is known for its fertile farmland, supporting agriculture such as dairy, cropping, and sheep
        farming. The area also has beautiful natural landscapes, including rivers, beaches, and forests, making it
        popular for outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, and cycling.
        The district combines a relaxed rural lifestyle with access to urban services from nearby Christchurch. It has
        been growing rapidly as people move there for more space while still commuting to the city. Waimakariri District
        balances nature, farming, and modern living in one diverse and vibrant region.

        Small gym but have everything I need. Zach is the best personal trainer I have ever had. He is very professional
        and always has a different workout programs for me every week. So I always learn new things from him. I’m so
        grateful to have him as my personal trainer. After training with him for only couple months, it makes me love
        myself more because I can see the difference although it’s just a little bit at the moment but I’m so happy.
        Highly recommended

        gym always a mess, weights out of place and never put away. trainers are to self centered to help put them away
        before cleaners come night. messy bathrooms.
        didnt take a complaint seriously nor never followed it up. only thing they know how to follow uo is when u miss
        a payment. no why havnt u come are you ok just wheres our money.
